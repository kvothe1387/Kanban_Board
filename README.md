# Kanban Board with Secure Login

This project is a Kanban board designed for Agile teams. It features a secure login system where users can log in, manage their work tasks, and have their session authenticated using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). 

## Features
- Secure login and logout using JWT for authentication.
- JWT stored securely in the client’s local storage.
- Access control to prevent unauthorized users from accessing the Kanban board.
- Auto-logout and JWT invalidation after session expiry.

## User Story

As a member of an Agile team,  
I want a Kanban board with a secure login page,  
So that I can securely access and manage my work tasks.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Given:
- A Kanban board with a secure login page.

### When:
- I load the login page.

### Then:
- I am presented with form inputs for username and password.

### When:
- I enter my valid username and password.

### Then:
- I am authenticated using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and redirected to the main Kanban board page.

### When:
- I enter an invalid username or password.

### Then:
- I am presented with an error message indicating that the credentials are incorrect.

### When:
- I successfully log in.

### Then:
- A JWT is stored securely in the client's local storage for subsequent authenticated requests.

### When:
- I log out.

### Then:
- The JWT is removed from the client’s local storage, and I am redirected to the login page.

### When:
- I try to access the Kanban board page without being authenticated.

### Then:
- I am redirected to the login page.

### When:
- I remain inactive for a defined period.

### Then:
- When my session expires, the JWT is invalidated, and I am redirected to the login page upon my next action.
